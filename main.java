system.out.println("1 - meters");
system.out.println("2 - inches");
system.out.println("3 - feet");
// put more in later

System.out.println("Please enter first the unit you would like to convert from and then the unit you would like to convert to");
double name = scanner.nextLine();
double name2 = scanner.nextLine();

System.out.println("Please enter the number of ${name} you would like to convert");
double num = scanner.nextDouble();

// Deciding on how best to convert the given metric
